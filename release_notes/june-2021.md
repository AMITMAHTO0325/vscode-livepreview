### Live Preview Task for Persistent Server

### Multi-root Support
When in a multi-root workspace, the extension will ask you which workspace to use for the server root. The other workspaces can still be previewed, although they will be treated as a out-of-workspace file. Upon changing workspaces, the embedded preview will auto-redirect if necessary.

### Out-of-workspace Preview
You can now even preview outside of a workspace! The server will simply create a custom endpoint for your new server root if necessary.

### Options for Preview Refresh
If you prefer to have less preview refreshes during editing, feel free to configure the extension to only refresh on file save.
